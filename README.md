# 📊 Decentralized Credit Builder

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that empowers unbanked individuals worldwide to verify their identities, build verifiable credit profiles, and access loans without relying on traditional banks! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project creates a global, decentralized credit ecosystem that's transparent, secure, and inclusive.

## ✨ Features

🔑 Decentralized identity (DID) registration and verification  
📈 Build and update credit profiles with on-chain history  
💰 Request and manage peer-to-peer loans  
🤝 Lender matching and automated loan disbursement  
🔄 Track repayments and credit score improvements  
⚖️ Dispute resolution for fair outcomes  
🛡️ Oracle integration for real-world data verification (e.g., income proofs)  
📜 Governance for community-driven updates  
🔒 Secure token staking for collateral and incentives  
🌍 Global accessibility for underserved populations

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to handle identity, credit building, lending, and governance. Here's a breakdown:

1. **IdentityContract.clar**: Registers decentralized identities (DIDs) with verifiable credentials (e.g., KYC via zero-knowledge proofs).  
2. **CreditProfileContract.clar**: Stores and updates borrower credit profiles, including scores calculated from repayment history.  
3. **LoanRequestContract.clar**: Allows borrowers to create loan requests with terms like amount, interest, and duration.  
4. **LenderMatchingContract.clar**: Matches lenders with borrowers and handles loan approvals via staking.  
5. **RepaymentContract.clar**: Manages automated repayments, interest calculations, and default handling.  
6. **OracleContract.clar**: Integrates external data feeds (e.g., for income verification) to enhance credit assessments.  
7. **DisputeResolutionContract.clar**: Enables arbitration for loan disputes using community voting or oracles.  
8. **GovernanceContract.clar**: A DAO-style contract for proposing and voting on platform upgrades, fee changes, or parameter tweaks.

**For Borrowers**  
- Register your DID using `register-identity` with a unique hash and proof.  
- Build your profile by calling `update-credit-profile` with initial data (e.g., self-reported income verified via oracle).  
- Submit a loan request via `create-loan-request` specifying terms.  
- Once matched, repay using `process-repayment` to boost your credit score automatically.  

Boom! You're building a global credit history that's portable and bank-independent.

**For Lenders**  
- Stake tokens in `LenderMatchingContract` to participate.  
- Review and approve requests with `approve-loan`.  
- Earn interest on successful repayments tracked in `RepaymentContract`.  
- In case of issues, initiate disputes via `file-dispute`.  

Lend securely with on-chain collateral and verifiable borrower data.

**For Verifiers (e.g., Future Lenders or Partners)**  
- Query `get-credit-profile` to view a borrower's history and score.  
- Use `verify-identity` to confirm DID authenticity.  
- Check loan status with `get-loan-details` for transparency.  

Instant, trustless verification to assess creditworthiness globally.

This setup solves real-world financial exclusion by enabling 1.7 billion unbanked adults to access credit, fostering economic growth in developing regions while ensuring security through blockchain immutability.
